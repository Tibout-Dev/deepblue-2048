# Deepblue 2048
This is my completed version of 2048's game using mainly Javascript.

- [x] Random 2-4 generator
- [x] Full movements using arrow keys
- [x] Merging tiles
- [x] Updating score
- [x] Loose or win alert
- [x] Restart the game by clicking on "Nouvelle partie" or press Enter

To build it, I took a look at how the "original" one was built.

My first javascript's project. I enjoyed a lot doing it!
